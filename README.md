## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was simple challenge with flexbox, very good to practice the BEM method and SCSS (with all card with its small tweaks). Learned how to use the BEM naming more efficient and not to duplicate unnecessary code.
